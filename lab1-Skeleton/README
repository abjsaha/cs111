We have no limitations to our knowledge. Our program is perfecto. Our execute_command function essentially is recursive.
Given the current command passed to it, if it is a simple command, it will fork. The child process is responsible for 
executing the command while the parent process is responsible for obtaining the exit status. In other cases where 
command[0] and command[1] are initialized, it executes the command recursively by forking then having each separate 
process call execute_command on each command. For synchonization purposes, the parent will call waitpid to ensure 
the child process finishes executing and exits before executing the next command.
