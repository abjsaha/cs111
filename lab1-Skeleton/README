To our knowledge, our program does not have any limitations that would cause it to behave incorrectly according to the spec requirements. Our implementation is separated into three major components. The first is reading in the input, parsing it, and deciding what to store in a temporary array that will be either a complete simple command or complete operator. This function
called handlechar then passes this temporary array to another function called growTree which is responsible for taking in the 
command or operator and deciding what to do with it using two separate stacks, an operator stack and a command stack, which are
both implemented using linked lists. These stacks are used to combine commands into a command tree. Lastly, this command tree 
is passed to addToCommandStream, which creates a linked list of root command nodes, each of which represent an entire command 
tree. Finally, we send this stream to read command stream.
